- **Stock Alerts**: Generate alerts based on price movement thresholds
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Support for various time intervals (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min, daily)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and API response validation
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with type definitions
- **MCP Protocol**: Compatible with MCP-enabled applications like Claude Desktop, VS Code, and more

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Alpha Vantage API key (free tier available)

## 🔑 Getting an API Key

## 🏗️ Development

### Building the Project

```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run build_tsc

# Webpack build
npm run build

# Development build
npm run build:dev
```


## 📈 API Rate Limits

Alpha Vantage API limits (free tier):
- **5 API requests per minute**
- **500 API requests per day**

Consider upgrading to a premium plan for higher limits if needed.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY is required" Error**
   - Ensure your API key is properly set in environment variables

2. **"API request failed" Error**
   - Verify your API key is valid
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded API rate limits

3. **"No time series data found" Error**
   - Verify the stock symbol is correct
   - Check if the market is open (for real-time data)
   - Try a different symbol or time interval

### Debug Mode

Run the server in development mode for detailed logging:

```bash
npm run dev
```
